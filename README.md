# SLT: Something Like TLS
This project works on The Playground framework. My project resembles the middleware protocols, HTTP and TLS. Few modifation from the original protocols were implemented in this project in regad to the floow of packets and their security, all is listed in a customized RFC. 

*I'm using Python’s asyncio library instead of (direct) socket access. Sockets are a form of “synchronous” communication. That means that the code moves in the typical flow from beginning to end.
