In the TCP/IP Attacks, Defenses and Security Tools document,
ICMP Attacks section. The ICMP defenses it says "Checking if the packet
belongs to the same connection or not," yet I though ICMP packets, like "ping"
wouldn't need to establish a connection before hand.

Also, "Changes in routes" for the second defense, is it referring to the
routers the packets is taking?

Finally, the last defense, "Replay packets should be accepted at a particular time,"
does it mean that there are a fixed time after sending the packet that the Replay packet
will be checked?
